## What is Aeróglifo?
Aeróglifo is a post-flight data analysis software for VANTs, created in 2015 for SAE Brasil Aerodesign competition. It reads a CSV file from a flight and organizes the data for an optimized readability. This software enables the user to **generate graphics** for multiple flight parameters and **add filters**. Aeróglifo has a built in **video analysis tool** in which is possible to **synchronize flight data and a video**.
